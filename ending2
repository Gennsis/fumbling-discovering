    m "\"You don’t even know whether he’s dead yet. How can you even think of fulfilling such a wish?\""
    r "\"But...\""
    "I take Rocky’s hesitation as a sign for me to continue."
    m "\"Also, I don’t know... Maybe none of us has thought about it before, but perhaps, not all sorcerers are that abhorrent. Perhaps, there are a few who are more compassionate than the others... Your friend is one example.\""
    m "\"Both of you know it. I don’t like the sorcerers. I hate them, in fact. But... we can’t make this wish without being certain for sure. Not when we may drag those who are innocent down.\""
    m "\"Besides, it is unfair towards Rocky. You never chose what capabilities you would have when you were born.\""

    t "\"I guess I have been way too consumed in my own hatred to think about the fact that not all sorcerers are that cold­hearted. It’s hilarious how I have been a hypocrite all along, when I have generalised others even when I dislike stereotypes myself.\""
    "A helpless sigh escapes Rocky; it sounds like it has surrendered to the cruel shape that is life."
    r "\"Still, I can do something... anything to change things. I am capable enough to do that! For him, for all the creatures...\""
    r "\"What use would these abilities be if I cannot even use them to help others?\""
    "A tsunami is raging to the point that I can feel the vibrations of the ground."
    r "\"Can I only stand by like this?\""
    m "\"Injustice always happens. It is not something that can be resolved with just one wish, but with constant effort by us.\""
    r "\"Perhaps you are right...\""
    "Eventually, none of us speak, for all three of us are consumed in our own thoughts."
    "All of a sudden, I notice the snowflakes that are plopping down the ground, and I watch them. It feels like I am watching the shadows of a being that we will never ever be."
    "When had it all begun? When humans were first tainted by the world of darkness, before spreading the corrupt over to us?"
    "I wonder."
