# Project details
This project is built using software engine Ren'Py which runs on the Python programming language. The text editor used is jEdit.

# Intrepid
Intrepid, started and completed in 2015, is an interactive game which consists of narration accompanied with visuals.
Nearing the end of the game, there are also sets of options which the player can choose. The player's decision would ultimately
affect the fate of the protagonist.

## Background 
Since young, I have had an avid interest in writing stories and creating digital graphics, so when I chanced upon this engine,
I was delighed to know that there is a medium which can bring all my favourite elements together into a game. It was also my first
time getting to know and learn more about programming. I found that programming gives the programmer a large degree of freedom to
add in features that they desire into the appliance they are creating.

## Learning experience
Every Ren'Py project started has a base code, so I modified the base code according to the needs of the game I planned out for. To learn
more about the commands involved in the code, I read up external materials from the Ren'Py website and also sought for advice in online
forums. Initially, I only wanted to include a customised Graphic User Interface in the game and different sets of facial expressions
for the sole character sprite in the game, but I found that drawing different sets of facial expressions was too troublesome and limited
in expressing the emotions of the character. Hence, I learnt more about setting multiple conditions for the sprite's character expressions.
Instead of defining variables by the whole facial expression, I decided to define variables by each facial feature (eyes, mouth and
bubbles). 
I realised that programming requires a lot of meticulousness and also a logical and creative mind, so that all the programming commands
can be used effectively to come up with the most desired outcome.
